# command-line-carwash-simulator
This project is a simple simulation of a car wash of multiple stages. Code is written in c++ language. 
Valid command are: 
1) add_stage <num_of_workers> <their_time_coefficient> . For example: add_stage 2 1 1
2) advance_time <time_steps> . For example: advance_time 2
3) add_car <luxury_coefficient> 
4) show_stage_info <stage_id>
5) show_carwash_info 
6) finish. This command continues the simulation untill job on all cars are finished.
